'''
My first original idea for a project.
Presenting my Rick and Morty episode ranomizer.
Run the code and get a random episode to watch.
- originally coded on SoloLearn -
version 1.1.2

import random

#Season Number = snum
snum = random.randint(1,4)

#Episode Number = epnum
#Season One has an extra episode
#Season Four is still being aired

if snum == 1:
    epnum = (random.randint(1,11))
elif snum == 2 or snum:
    epnum = (random.randint(1,10))
elif snum == 4:
    epnum = (random.randint(1,5))
    
print ("Season "+str(snum))
print("Episode "+str(epnum))

epchoice = []

epchoice.append(snum)
epchoice.append(epnum)
print(epchoice)
